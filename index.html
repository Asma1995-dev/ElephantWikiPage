<h3>Habitat</h3>
  <img src="elephant2.jpg" height="300" width="400" >
  <p>Elephants can be found in the desert of the Savannah, forest areas, where there are swamps, and everything in between. They form emigrational paths that they continue to follow year after year. This allows them to take advantage of the foods that grow in various areas. Today most of the elephants remaining in Africa live in National Parks. These areas have been put in place to help give them plenty of room to survive. They are also well protected in these locations to help the population count rise. However, this can be stressful for the elephants as they love the ability to freely roam. They also love to play and to bathe in water so they don’t mind traveling long distances to find it.They don’t have predators other than humans so when they do move to new habitats being able to find adequate supplies of food is the one thing that they have to worry about.</p>
