    <p>Elephants are herbivores and feed entirely on naturally growing plants and shrubs. Elephants adapted themselves to live on the green leaves nature grows on her kind breast and drinks from her eyes, to be specific from nearby water bodies. For choosing such a vegetarian diet the internal environment of their body and their outer eating parts started to transform. Now, an elephant has flat teeth to grind the leaves and tusks to rip the bark off from a tree. Elephants can eat an average of 150-160 kg of food in a day!  An elephant also drinks an average of 40-45 liters of water in just a single day.</p>
